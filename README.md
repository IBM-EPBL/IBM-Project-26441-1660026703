Personal Assistance for Seniors Who Are Self-Reliant
Sometimes elderly people forget to take their medicine at the correct time.
They also forget which medicine He / She should take at that particular time.
And it is difficult for doctors/caretakers to monitor the patients around the clock. To avoid this problem, this medicine reminder system is developed.
An app is built for the user (caretaker) which enables him to set the desired time and medicine
